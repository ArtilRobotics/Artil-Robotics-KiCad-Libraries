Its ability to convert both higher and lower input voltages makes it useful for applications where the power supply voltage can vary greatly, as with batteries that start above but discharge below 5 V. The board measures 0.35″ × 0.475″, has a typical efficiency of 85% to 95%, and can supply a typical continuous output current of around 1 A." (id 5) (at 0 0 0)
